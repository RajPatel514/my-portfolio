        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone! My name is Raj Patel, and I am studying computer programming at Humber College. I've taken a
            big step in a new direction to learn something new! This discipline will eventually help me make a shift in
            my career. I am currently working on a few web development projects on the side, as well as being a
            self-employed contractor. I was a machinist for five years prior to that. I am looking forward to what and
            where this new journey will bring me, thank you for visiting my page!</p>
